# Product-Analyst-Project
A product analysis of an e-commerce store.
Objective:
The project was centered on quantifying the user journey on an e-commerce website, specifically measuring the time from a user's initial arrival on the site to their first purchase on the same day. This analysis aimed to provide insights into user behavior and the purchasing process.

Approach and Tools Used:
Data Extraction with SQL: Executed sophisticated SQL queries to extract relevant data from the turing_data_analytics.raw_events table in BigQuery. Emphasis was placed on identifying the correct columns and applying logical query structures.
Data Analysis & Visualization: Utilized tools like Google Spreadsheets, Tableau, or Looker Studio for data visualization. The focus was on creating clear, interpretable visualizations to convey the daily dynamics of the duration from site visit to purchase.
Presentation Development: Prepared a concise presentation that not only highlighted the key findings but also incorporated 1-2 advanced analytical techniques learned during the course.
Key Insights and Findings:
Detailed analysis of the average time users spend on the site before making a purchase, with day-to-day variations.
Identification of factors that might influence the duration to purchase, such as website design, user interface, and special offers.
Challenges and Further Analysis:
Discussed potential biases and limitations in the current analysis, such as confirmation bias and the impact of external factors.
Suggested further analyses, including deeper dives into clickstream data and counterfactual scenarios to enhance understanding of user behavior.
Conclusions:
This project demonstrates my ability to conduct in-depth, meaningful analysis of user engagement metrics in an e-commerce setting. My approach combines technical SQL proficiency with advanced data visualization skills, all while maintaining an analytical mindset to address complex business problems.
